# Innovations for open science at MozFest2017

As Festival Lunch partner, we facilitated activities and workshops on open science at MozFest 2017. You can read more about this here.

# The projects

## eLife Open Science Soapbox

On Sunday October 29, eLife hosted an open science soapbox over lunch. Attendees had two minutes to share their project or new idea, and outline how the community could help them, in front of a captive audience. 

[Watch the presentations on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOAy5WJPezEjOyOBRL-PPYz3qZg_KSPur)

All the projects and ideas presented are featured as [issues in this repo](link to issues with soapbox tag).

## The Open Science Public Park

We also hosted a weekend-long installation on the Open Innovation floor — the Open Science Public Park. Centred around a 'wish tree' for project leads to display their projects, and for attendees to pledge contributions to these projects.

It was fantastic to see the projects and contributions on offer — you can view them all in this [Flickr gallery](https://flic.kr/s/aHsm8J7zTf) and they are included as [issues in this repo](issues with wish-tree tag).

# Contribute to the projects

Explore the issues in this repo relating to the [soapbox](tag) and the [wish tree](tag). The project leads have outlined any contributions they are seeking. If something interests you, please reach out to the project lead as indicated. Please also feel free to react, support and discuss the projects and ideas via these issues (and tag the project lead where possible!).
